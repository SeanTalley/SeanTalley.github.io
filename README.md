# Chess Against GPT
ChatGPT built this chess game using chess.js and chessboard.js to make API calls to itself to recommend moves. 

Play chess against the OpenAI API.

In order to play, you must have an API key from OpenAI.

You can generate one here: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

This must be placed at the top of game.js overwriting the line: `var OpenAIApiKey = "{API KEY GOES HERE}"`
